# cell-eval

## Description

This package provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for evaluating the performance of models that predict cellular responses to perturbations at the single-cell level. It can be used either as a command-line tool or as a Python module.

## Installation

Distribution with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
# install from pypi
uv pip install -U cell-eval

# install from github directly
uv pip install -U git+https://github.com/arcinstitute/cell-eval

# install cli with uv tool
uv tool install -U git+https://github.com/arcinstitute/cell-eval

# Check installation
cell-eval --help
```

## Usage

To get started you'll need to have two anndata files.

1. a predicted anndata (`adata_pred`).
2. a real anndata to compare against (`adata_real`).

### Prep (VCC)

To prepare an anndata for [VCC evaluation](https://virtualcellchallenge.org/) you can use the `cell-eval prep` command.
This will strip the anndata to bare essentials, compress it, adjust naming conventions, and ensure compatibility with the evaluation framework.

This step is optional for downstream usage, but recommended for optimal performance and compatibility.

Run this on your predicted anndata:

```bash
cell-eval prep \
    -i <your/path/to>.h5ad \
    -g <expected_genelist>
```

### Run

To run an evaluation between two anndatas you can use the `cell-eval run` command.

This will run [differential expression](https://github.com/arcinstitute/pdex) for each anndata and then run a suite of
evaluation metrics to compare the two (select your suite of metrics with the `--profile` flag).

To save time you can submit precomputed differential expression results, see the `cell-eval run --help` menu for more information.

```bash
cell-eval run \
    -ap <your/path/to/pred>.h5ad \
    -ar <your/path/to/real>.h5ad \
    --num-threads 64 \
    --profile full
```

To run this as a python module you will need to use the `MetricsEvaluator` class.

```python
from cell_eval import MetricsEvaluator
from cell_eval.data import build_random_anndata, downsample_cells

adata_real = build_random_anndata()
adata_pred = downsample_cells(adata_real, fraction=0.5)
evaluator = MetricsEvaluator(
    adata_pred=adata_pred,
    adata_real=adata_real,
    control_pert="control",
    pert_col="perturbation",
    num_threads=64,
)
(results, agg_results) = evaluator.compute()
```

This will give you metric evaluations for each perturbation individually (`results`) and aggregated results over all perturbations (`agg_results`).

The `full` profile includes two DEG-weighted expression metrics:

- `wmse`: weighted MSE between predicted and real perturbation pseudobulks.
- `weighted_pearson_delta`: weighted Pearson correlation between predicted and real perturbation-minus-control effects.

Weights are derived only from the real perturbation-versus-control DE results. By default,
two-sided DE p-values are converted to absolute normal-equivalent scores, then transformed
per perturbation using min-max scaling, squaring, and sum normalization. Python callers can
instead weight by absolute log2 fold change:

```python
results, agg_results = evaluator.compute(
    metric_configs={
        "wmse": {"weight_source": "abs_log2_fold_change"},
        "weighted_pearson_delta": {
            "weight_source": "abs_log2_fold_change"
        },
    }
)
```

#### Data ceiling

To estimate the *maximum* achievable score on each metric given the noise inherent in the real
data, pass `--ceiling`. This is computed from the **real data only**: each perturbation's cells
(and the control's) are split into two *disjoint* halves of `n/2` cells (no cell in both), one half
plays "real" and the other "prediction", and the full metric suite is run on that self-split.
Averaging each metric over perturbations and applying the analytical Spearman-Brown correction
`r' = 2r/(1+r)` maps that per-context mean from half depth back to full depth. The result is, per
metric, an unbiased upper bound on how well any model could score on this dataset.

A disjoint split is used rather than a bootstrap self-split: a bootstrap draws the two halves from
the same cells, so they are not independent, which biases the ceiling in *both* directions (so it is
not a reliable upper bound). The shared cells make the halves agree more than two independent
samples would (inflating it), while the duplicate cells over-call the FDR-gated DE metrics and drag
the recovery metrics (recall / overlap / AUC) down. The disjoint split is unbiased but shallow (each
half `n/2`), which the Spearman-Brown doubling corrects.

The correction is applied only to a fixed set of reliability metrics (the `SB_METRICS` list in
`_evaluator.py`); every other metric — error metrics, unbounded counts, and reliability metrics
left off that list (`clustering_agreement`, `pearson_edistance`) — is reported as `NaN`.

```bash
cell-eval run \
    -ap <your/path/to/pred>.h5ad \
    -ar <your/path/to/real>.h5ad \
    --num-threads 64 \
    --profile full \
    --ceiling
```

This is *additive*: it writes the normal `results.csv` / `agg_results.csv` **and**
`ceiling_results.csv` (the raw per-perturbation self-split) / `agg_ceiling_results.csv` (the
SB-corrected per-metric ceiling). The split is reproducible via `--ceiling-seed` (default `0`). From
python, call `compute_ceiling` on the evaluator:

```python
ceiling, ceiling_agg = evaluator.compute_ceiling(seed=0)
```

### Score

To normalize your scores against a baseline you can run the `cell-eval score` command.

This accepts two `agg_results.csv` (or `agg_results` objects in python) as input.

```bash
cell-eval score \
    --user-input <your/path/to/user>/agg_results.csv \
    --base-input <your/path/to/base>/agg_results.csv
```

Or from python:

```python
from cell_eval import score_agg_metrics

user_input = "./cell-eval-user/agg_results.csv"
base_input = "./cell-eval-base/agg_results.csv"
output_path = "./score.csv"

score_agg_metrics(
    results_user=user_input,
    results_base=base_input,
    output=output_path,
)
```

## Library Design

The metrics are built using the python registry pattern. This allows for easy extension for new metrics with a well-typed interface.

Take a look at existing metrics in `cell_eval.metrics` to get started.
