        Uses the real data only. Each perturbation's cells (and the control's) are
        split into two *disjoint* halves of ``floor(n/2)`` cells - no cell in both -
        and one half is treated as "real", the other as "prediction". Running the
        normal metric pipeline on that self-split measures each metric per
        perturbation at half depth; averaging over perturbations and applying the
        Spearman-Brown correction ``r' = 2r/(1+r)`` maps that per-context mean to
        full depth (``n``), an unbiased upper bound on how well any model could
        score given the noise inherent in the real data.

        A *disjoint* split is used (rather than a bootstrap self-split) because a
        bootstrap draws both halves from the same cells, so they are not
        independent - which biases the ceiling in both directions: shared cells
        make the halves over-agree (inflating it), while duplicate cells over-call
        the FDR-gated DE metrics and drag the recovery metrics down. The cost of a
        disjoint split is depth (each half is ``n/2``), which the Spearman-Brown
        doubling corrects for.

        The correction is applied only to the reliability metrics listed in the
        module-level ``SB_METRICS`` set (bounded, higher-is-better, and empirically
        well-behaved under doubling), and only where the measured reliability is
        ``r > 0`` - below that the correction is a pole rather than a correction, so
        it is reported as ``NaN`` (see :func:`_spearman_brown_correct`). Every other
        metric - error metrics, unbounded counts, and reliability metrics left off
        that list (``clustering_agreement``, ``pearson_edistance``) - is emitted as
        ``NaN`` (no defensible ceiling).

        ``ceiling_results.csv`` holds the raw per-perturbation self-split scores;
        ``agg_ceiling_results.csv`` holds the SB-corrected per-metric ceiling. The
        self-split DE is computed in-memory and never written. The same
        ``pdex_kwargs`` and ``allow_discrete`` as the main evaluation are reused so
        the ceiling is directly comparable.

        Cost: the two halves are materialized as copies, so peak memory is roughly
        ``2x`` the real matrix on top of the already-loaded pair, and the self-split
        DE is computed for both halves - so a ceiling run roughly doubles the wall
        time. A precomputed ``de_real``/``de_pred`` does not carry over to the
        ceiling: the halves are new data and need their own DE.
